        <p>Review on the Go is a feature that enables you - as a reviewer - to conveniently verify the accuracy and quality of documents <b>from any browser</b> on your favorite mobile or tablet device. Anyone with access to the Working Papers engagement file can share individual documents to Cloud, making it convenient for partners or senior staff to review documents and provide instant feedback, without having to install Working Papers, pass documents back and forth via email, or attend numerous meetings.</p>
        <p>Reviewers can make changes to any document and create review notes for the engagement team to resolve. The feedback is instantaneous and merged directly into the Working Papers engagement file. Team members that have the Working Papers file open and in an "online" state, automatically receive the changes from the reviewer.</p>
        <p>The reverse situation is not true, however. If an engagement team member makes a change to a document that was already sent for review, then the reviewer will not be able to see the specific update; only an indication that the document has been modified. Only by re-sending the document for review, can the reviewer see the specific updates to the file.</p>
        <p>The following diagram shows the basic workflow for Review on the Go:</p>
        <p>

        <h2 id="Set-up-Working-Papers-on-Cloud">Set up Working Papers on Cloud</h2>
        <p>In order to start using Review on the Go, you need to enable Working Papers integration with CaseWare Cloud. For more information about integration, see <a href="../../Setup/Environments-and-Configuration/Integrate-your-Working-Papers-with-Cloud.htm">Integrate your Working Papers with Cloud</a>.</p>
        <p>Once the connection is established, ensure to <a href="../../Engagements/Planning/Share-a-Working-Papers-SmartSync-file-on-Cloud.htm#Creating">create a primary (parent)&#160;copy</a> on Cloud so that your engagement team can all work in the file at the same time. This process is known as publishing the file. After the file has been published, your team can <a href="../../Engagements/Planning/Share-a-Working-Papers-SmartSync-file-on-Cloud.htm#Creating2">create sync copies</a> to begin working in the file together.</p>
        <p>Next, ensure role sets are defined so that you can track which roles have signed off on the document.</p>
        <h3 id="Create-and-modify-role-sets">Create and modify role sets</h3>
        <p>Review on the Go uses the role sets defined in the Working Papers file.  You can add, modify or delete a role set to be used in the Review on the Go session.</p>

        <p>You have created, modified, or deleted the role set for your client file. Your engagement team can now use these roles when reviewing files in Review on the Go. Ensure that all document collaborators are synced and have received these changes.</p>
        <h2 id="Send-documents-for-review">Send documents for review</h2>
        <p>When you are ready to submit your assigned documents for review, you can use Review on the Go to help manage the process.</p>

        <p>You can set up a review session using CaseWare® Working Papers. Each review session using Review on the Go creates an active synchronization between the client file and CaseWare Cloud.</p>
