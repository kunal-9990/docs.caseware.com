        <h1>Onboarding staff (1 to 10 people)</h1>
        <p>When you're ready to provide staff with accounts in Cloud, you can begin onboarding procedures. Generally, the procedures are the same for all organization sizes:&#160;</p>
        <ol>
            <li value="1">
                <p>Create groups based on functional roles and access rights.</p>
            </li>
            <li value="2">
                <p>Create accounts for each staff member.</p>
            </li>
            <li value="3">
                <p>Assign roles to each group or staff member to grant them access to Cloud.</p>
            </li>
        </ol>
        <p class="bestpractice inline"><b>Best Practice:</b>&#160;For organizations with 1 to 10 people, it's generally easier to provide users and groups with system-wide roles. This grants all staff members with access to everything. Where appropriate, you can create private entities or items to limit access.</p>
        <h2 id="Create-user-groups">Create user groups</h2>
        <p>Before you begin to add staff or contacts, you can get started on your organization's framework by creating <b>groups</b>. Groups in Cloud are useful because you can control security settings and file access for multiple users at once. </p>
        <p>For example, you could create separate staff groups for accountants and managers or partners. This would enable staff of both seniority level to share files and collaborate without having to change permissions at the level of individual users.</p>
        <p><b>To create a new group:</b>
        </p>
        <ol>
            <li value="1">
                <p>Ensure that you have the <i>Staff Admin</i> role or equivalent privileges.</p>
            </li>
            <li value="2">
                <p>From the Cloud Menu, select <b>Groups</b>.</p>
            </li>
            <li value="3">
                <p>Select <b>New</b>, then choose <b>Staff Group</b> or <b>Contacts Group</b>. The New Group dialog opens.</p>
                <p>
                    <img src="/documentation_files/2018/webapps/29/Content/en/Resources//Images/Screenshots/New-group-795x447.png" alt="The Add Staff Group dialog" />
                </p>
            </li>
            <li value="4">
                <p>Enter a <b>Name</b> and <b>Description</b> for your group.</p>
            </li>
            <li value="5">
                <p>From the sidebar, select <b>Members</b>. Choose the users you want to add to this group.</p>
            </li>
            <li value="6">
                <p>If you have the <i>Admin</i> role or equivalent permissions, you can also assign <b>System-Wide Roles</b>.</p>
            </li>
            <li value="7">
                <p>Select <b>Save</b>.</p>
            </li>
        </ol>
        <p>You have successfully created a staff group and you have assigned your staff members to it. </p>
        <p>Once your staff members are set up on Cloud, you can give them access to client workspaces. In Cloud, these workspaces are called <b>entities</b>. For more information about granting access to client entities, see <a href="../../Setup/Users-and-Groups/Set-staff-access-levels.htm" class="MCXref xref">Set staff access levels</a>.</p>
        <p>CaseWare Cloud offers two methods for adding staff members or contacts to your organization: <a href="../../Setup/Users-and-Groups/Importing-staff-members-or-contacts-from-a-list.htm">importing a staff directory</a> using a .csv file or delimited block of text, or adding staff individually in Cloud. If your organization has fewer than 50 staff members, we recommend creating each staff profile individually.</p>
        <p>After your staff members and contacts are added to Cloud, you will need to configure their <b>system-wide</b>, <b>entity-wide</b> and <b>file-specific</b> roles as appropriate.</p>
        <h2 id="Create-user-accounts">Create user accounts</h2>
        <p>You can add Staff or Contact users from the <b>Staff</b> or <b>Contacts</b> page. The procedure for both user types is the same.</p>
        <p><b>To add an individual user:</b>
        </p>
        <ol>
            <li value="1">
                <p>Ensure that you have the <i>Staff Admin</i> role or equivalent rights.</p>
            </li>
            <li value="2">
                <p>From the Cloud menu, select <b>Staff</b> or <b>Contacts</b>.</p>
            </li>
            <li value="3">
                <p>Select <b>New</b> and, under Add, select <b>Staff</b> or <b>Contacts</b>.</p>
                <p>
                    <img src="/documentation_files/2018/webapps/29/Content/en/Resources//Project Files/StaffAndContacts/Images/Staff-add-individual-755x327.png" style="border: 1px solid #3f66a3;" alt="Add individual users from the staff or contacts page" />
                </p>
            </li>
            <li value="4">
                <p>Enter the appropriate name and contact information.</p>
                <p class="inline note"><b>Note</b>: If you are adding a contact and you do not want to create an account for them, leave the <b>Email</b> field blank.</p>
            </li>
            <li value="5">
                <p>If you want to set the user’s password, select the <b>Password</b> pane, select <b>Set</b>, and enter the new password. Otherwise, the user will set their password.</p>
            </li>
            <li value="6">
                <p>Select <b>Save</b>.</p>
            </li>
        </ol>
        <h2 id="Assigning-user-roles">Assign user roles</h2>
        <p>If your organization comprises a few partners who all have equal access to client information, you can implement a very simple security policy. You can grant all staff members access to all entities by giving them the <i>Owner</i> role. This policy is the simplest to manage, but you can only use it if all users have equal access to confidential client information.</p>
        <p>If your organization comprises one or two partners and a few associates who support your work, you can make a slightly more complex policy. The partners should have all system-wide roles:</p>
        <ul>
            <li value="1">
                <p><b style="font-style: italic; font-weight: normal;">Settings Admin</b>
                </p>
            </li>
            <li value="2">
                <p><i>Staff Admin</i>
                </p>
            </li>
            <li value="3">
                <p><i>Entities Admin</i>
                </p>
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p>Your associates should have the <i>Entity Access</i> role. This will let them see all entities that you create, but they will only be able to see content under the entities that a partner shares with them. This means that whenever a partner adds content to an entity, they will choose which associates have access to it.</p>
        <h3 id="Assign-firm-wide-roles">Assign system-wide roles</h3>
        <p>There are some security roles that you may want to apply to all content. For example, partners may need to have the ability to view all of the entities for your organization, and to edit or delete these entities on demand. </p>
        <p>You can grant this access by assigning system-wide security roles to users or groups.</p>
        <p><b>To assign system-wide roles to a user or group:</b>
        </p>
        <ol>
            <li value="1">
                <p>Ensure that you have the <i>Staff Admin</i> role or equivalent privileges.</p>
            </li>
            <li value="2">
                <p>From the Cloud menu, select <b>Groups</b> or <b>Staff</b>.</p>
            </li>
            <li value="3">
                <p>Select the user or group you want to edit the roles for, then select the <b>Edit</b>button (<img src="/documentation_files/2018/webapps/29/Content/en/Resources//Icons/Edit-16x16.png" />).</p>
            </li>
            <li value="4">
                <p>Select the <b>System-Wide Roles</b> tab and select the appropriate roles.</p>
                <p>
                    <img src="/documentation_files/2018/webapps/29/Content/en/Resources//Images/staff-contacts-groups-edit-system-wide-roles.png" alt="Available system-wide roles displayed on a staff member's profile." />
                </p>
            </li>
            <li value="5">
                <p>Select <b>Save</b>.</p>
            </li>
        </ol>
        <h3>Grant entity access</h3>
        <p>In contrast to granting system-wide access, there may be some staff who should not be able to see everything in Cloud. You may grant a manager the ability to manage all content for a specific client, or you may want to only assign staff members to specific engagements so that they know that all activities on their Cloud timeline are relevant for their work assignments.</p>
        <p>You can achieve this by granting access to specific entities.</p>
        <p><b>To grant access to an entity:</b>
        </p>
        <ol>
            <li value="1">
                <p>Ensure that you have the <i>Owner</i> role or the equivalent privileges for the entity.</p>
            </li>
            <li value="2">
                <p>From the Cloud menu (<img src="/documentation_files/2018/webapps/29/Content/en/Resources//Icons/cloud-menu-16x11.png" style="vertical-align: text-bottom;" />), select <b>Entities</b>.</p>
            </li>
            <li value="3">
                <p>Select the entity you want to grant access to, then select <b>Share</b> (<img src="/documentation_files/2018/webapps/29/Content/en/Resources//Icons/Share-16x16.png" style="vertical-align: text-bottom;" />).</p>

                </p>
            </li>
            <li value="4">
                <p>Search for the groups, staff members or contacts you want to grant access to, then select <b>Assign Roles to (#)</b> and choose the appropriate role. Any roles that users already have due to previous settings appear under <b>Inherited</b>.</p>
                <p>

        </ol>
        <h3 id="Assign-roles-on-selected-content">Assign roles on selected content</h3>
        <p>If the team members working on an engagement do not need to see each others’ documents or activities, you can assign security roles to your users for individual files.</p>
        <p>First, you need to grant your user the <i>Entity Access</i> role for the entity where these individual files will be added. This role permits users to see the entity in Cloud, but doesn’t grant any other access to the content under that entity.</p>
        <p><b>To grant the Entity Access role:</b>
