        <p>Once this document is completed and signed off on, you're ready to begin your tax engagement work.</p>
        <h2>Complete the tax documents</h2>
        <p>With the tax data imported and the profile documents completed, you're ready to begin completing the engagement's federal and provincial tax forms. Since you completed the Tax Optimizer document, Review and Compilation – Canada should only list the forms that are relevant to your tax engagement. </p>
        <p>To see the complete list of available tax forms, not just the ones that Review and Compilation – Canada has determined are relevant to your engagement, select the <b>Edit</b> icon (<img src="/Resources/Images/Tax-edit-icon.png" />) on the Documents page, or open the <b>Tax Forms List</b> document. Use your browser's search function (<b>ctrl-f</b>) to help locate specific documents.</p>
        <p>Your selections also determine which  <b>workcharts</b>, if any, are listed. Workcharts are documents designed to streamline your engagement work. </p>
        <h3>Navigate between related tax documents</h3>
        <p>Review and Compilation – Canada makes it easy to navigate between workcharts and their linked schedule documents. The CompTax interface offers two options for moving between these documents.</p>
        <h4>Jump To Source</h4>
        <p>When you select a field that has a single source, you will see this dialog:</p>
        <p>
            <img src="/Resources/Images/Jump-to-source-613x191.png" />
        </p>
        <div class="pagebreak">
        </div>
        <p>When you select Jump To Source,  the source document opens and jumps to the appropriate line, with the exact source field highlighted in flashing blue.</p>

            <img src="/Resources/Images/Tax-highlighted-field-744x404.png" />
        </p>
        <h4>Viewer</h4>
        <p>In documents where an entire row of data is derived from one specific document, you’ll see a <b>Viewer</b> icon (<img src="/Resources/Images/Viewer-icon-25x23.png" />) to the right of the row. This feature opens the linked document in a pop-up display without opening a new browser window. For example, each class listed in the <b>S8 - Capital Class Allocation</b> document is linked to its corresponding page from the CCA Worksheet.</p>
        <p>
            <img src="/Resources/Images/CompTax-select-viewer-1330x450.png" />
        </p>
        <h2>Example workflow</h2>
        <p>In this example, your client has purchased a new fixed asset, in this case, a newly purchased building. The <b>S8 - CCA Workchart</b> is used to manage fixed assets, so this is the workchart you would select.</p>
        <p>With the workchart open, you will want to select the appropriate class for the firm's new fixed asset. Select the <b>add</b> icon (<img src="/Resources/Images/Tax-add-icon.png" />) in the CCA Class field.</p>
        <p>
            <img src="/Resources/Images/Tax-add-asset-class.png" />

        <p>Select the appropriate CCA class, then select <b>OK</b>.</p>
        <p>
            <img src="/Resources/Images/Tax-select-asset-class.png" />
        </p>
        <div class="pagebreak">
        </div>
        <p>Scroll to the bottom of the workchart, then select <b>add</b> (<img src="/Resources/Images/SE-add-icon.png" />). On the new line, select the <b>Viewer</b> icon (<img src="/Resources/Images/Viewer-icon-25x23.png" />). A new modal opens, and you can enter the new asset's information.</p>
        <p>

        </p>
        <h2>Correct outstanding errors or issues</h2>
        <p>If there are any outstanding issues with your return, you will be unable to file it. Select the  <b>DIAG - Diagnostics Workchart</b> document to view the engagement's outstanding issues. Select <b>E-File Diagnostics</b> to filter the list of issues to only display those that will prevent an electronic filing.</p>
        <p>
            <img src="/Resources/Images/Diagnostics-workchart.png" />

            <img src="/Resources/Images/Diagnostic-jump-to-issue.png" />
        </p>
        <h2>E-filing the return to the CRA</h2>
        <p>With the tax data imported, the engagement work complete, and all outstanding issues fixed, you can begin to plan your electronic filing via the CRA's <b>EFILE</b> program. Select <b>EFILE</b> from the top menu.</p>
        <p class="note inline"><b>Note</b>: Review and Compilation – Canada currently does not enable you to submit an <b>RC4649 - Country by Country Return</b> form.</p>
        <p>
            <img src="/Resources/Images/Tax-EFILE.png" />
        </p>
        <p>From the <b>EI - Efile Information</b> document, you can file your return to the CRA via one of two sets of credentials - if your firm is a Certified Tax Preparer, you can enter your CRA <b>Login Information</b>; alternatively, you can enter a <b>WACode</b> (Web Access Code) provided by the client.</p>
        <p>If you require a Web Access Code and have not yet been provided with one, select <b>WAC - Web Access Code Online Request</b> and complete the request form.</p>
        <h2>Printing the return</h2>
        <p>If your client requests a copy of the return for their records, you can create a PDF file which can then be saved to disk and shared with the client electronically</p>
        <p>Select <b>Print</b> from any open tax document to select the document you want to print.</p>
